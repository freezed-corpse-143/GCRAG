Let's think step by step.
- Thought: reason about the current situation and formulate a sub-question. Your Thought process should aim to formulate as simple and specific a question as possible, which should include a clear description of the key entitiesâ€™ features.
- Answer:  answer the sub-question proposed in the Thought step and give some explanations.

Format:
Question: a complex question
Thought 1: The first sub-question
Answer 1: answer the first sub-question
... (the Thought and Answer steps can repeat N times)
Thought n: the final thought
Answer n: FINISH[the final answer]

Please read the input question, answer and supporting facts, follow these instructions:
1. Your output should be in the format above.
2. Question be filled with input quesiton.
3. Each supporting fact should be used to generate "Thought" and "Answer".
4. Last thought should foucs on the question. Last Answer should be in the format of "Answer n: FINISH[<input answer>]", which is filled with the input answer.
